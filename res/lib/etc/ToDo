Notes:
Commit ee5012d changed to "Library.xml" file, please move to atleast that commit


<--Objects-->
1.Object layer needs to load Library for objects and reference them
2.key and door functionality: collect key, button, kill all enemies, kill boss.
3.Enemy "behaviors", start with basic movement, extend to full movement
4.create a ai scripting system to work with behaviors

<--Lighting-->
1.add ability to have a tile set of multiple lights
(either a collection, or sml/med/lrg tile sets)
2.light attached to player separate from tiled (WIP)
3.light attached to objects, glowshroom,  and techlight etc


<--Animations-->
1.add jetpack jump and hover animations for player (WIP)
2.animated tiles and objects that are non player(ala flickering candle) (WIP)


<--Collisions-->
1.Collision event handling (Player hit spikes,player collided with health)
2.Collision of slanted objects and tiles


<--Map Editing-->
1.Fix offsets between items in tiled and in game(WIP)
(Note: issue is due to sizing property, need to switch to "scale" factor)
2.instead of light icon, tile set will be outline of light shape and size
3.add parallax property to layers
(value of zero is no movement, negative numbers move one direction,
positive the other relative to player, magnitude of number  increases movement)


<--Engine Features-->
1.fix tiled vs engine light position offset(WIP)
(Note: when we move details of object into library, it wont give us trouble)
1.live mode that doesnâ€™t reset player back to spawn
2.live mode that allows player movement
3.reset/reload level option
4.add key command to bring up DEBUG mode with buttons and sliders to turn on/off:
(live mode, reset level, uncheck lights, enemies, raise lower volume,  slo-mo mode)
5."Warp Pad", fade sprite , move camera to location fade back in.
6.scaled objects independently from camera zoom

<--Library-->
1.increase and extend xml,  Library.xml for overall game properties,  player, enemy, etc (WIP)
2.Object layer needs to reference to XML object list instead of hand typing all properties(WIP)
