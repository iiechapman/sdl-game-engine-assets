To Do:  NOT in order of priority.  map creation and lighting issues are first things

**NOTE: PLEASE UPDATE TO COMMIT ee5012d before editing levels!**
** Changed To Library File**



<--Objects-->
Object layer needs to load tilesets for objects and reference them


-add ability to have a tile set of multiple lights
  -either a collection, or sml/med/lrg tile sets

  -light attached to player separate from tiled
  -light attached to objects, glowshroom,  and techlight etc

  -key and door functionality: collect key, button, kill all enemies, kill boss.

  -place “enemies” default movement, random for now

  -create a ai scripting system

<--Animations-->
-add jetpack jump and hover animations

-animated tiles and objects that are non player(ala flickering candle)


<--Collisions-->
-collision of slanted objects and tiles.



<--Map Editing-->
-instead of light icon, tile set will be outline of light shape and size

-add parallax property to layers, value of zero is no movement, negative numbers move one direction, positive the other relative to player, magnitude of number  increases movement.

<--Engine Features-->
-live mode that doesn’t reset player back to spawn
-live mode that allows player movement
-reset/reload level option
-add key command to bring up DEBUG mode with buttons and sliders to turn on/off live mode, reset level, uncheck lights, enemies, raise lower volume,  slo-mo mode.
Convert state parser from load "levels" to load "scenes"
-fix tiled vs engine light position offset
-warp-pad, fade sprite , move camera to location fade back in.
scaled objects independently from camera zoom

<--Library-->
-increase and extend xml,  game.xml for overall game properties,  player, enemy, etc
Object layer needs to reference to XML object list instead of hand typing all properties
